title: "PSKY Amends Tender Offer, Adds Larry Ellison Personal Guarantee"
fact: "Paramount Skydance amended its $30/share tender offer to address WBD Board's stated concerns. The amended offer includes a personal equity financing guarantee from Larry Ellison of $40.4 billion, an increased reverse termination fee from $5.0 billion to $5.8 billion (matching Netflix), and enhanced financial flexibility during an interim period. The core offer price of $30.00 per share in cash remains unchanged, and the offer still expires January 8, 2026 unless extended. WBD confirmed receipt and stated the Board will carefully review the amended offer in consultation with advisors and in accordance with the terms of the Netflix Merger Agreement."
context: "This is PSKY's response to getting rejected. The WBD Board's 14D-9 filing called out two specific weaknesses: inadequate financing certainty (relying on a revocable trust rather than a personal guarantee) and a lower reverse breakup fee than Netflix. PSKY addressed both. Larry Ellison's personal guarantee is exactly what WBD said was missing. The $5.8 billion reverse fee now matches Netflix dollar-for-dollar. From a corporate actions perspective, this is classic hostile tender offer mechanics. When your initial terms get rejected, you don't walk away—you address the stated objections and re-engage. PSKY is forcing the WBD Board to evaluate again. The question now: were those really the Board's core objections, or were they negotiating positions masking a fundamental preference for the Netflix structure? The Board's response will tell us whether this was about the terms or the transaction itself."
