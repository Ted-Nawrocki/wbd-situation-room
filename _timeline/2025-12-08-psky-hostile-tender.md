title: "PSKY Launches Hostile Tender Offer"
fact: "Paramount Skydance launched an unsolicited all-cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding WBD shares at $30.00 per share. The offer is subject to multiple conditions, including that WBD enter into PSKY's proposed merger agreement, abandon the separation plan, and terminate the Netflix merger agreement. The offer is scheduled to expire January 8, 2026, unless extended."
context: "When negotiation fails, you go hostile. The $30 headline looks clean—higher than Netflix's reported $27.75—but the conditions tell the real story. PSKY needs WBD to sign their merger agreement, kill the separation, and walk away from Netflix. That's not a tender offer with optional board approval. That's a tender offer that can't close without the board capitulating first. Mechanically, this puts enormous pressure on WBD's process, but it also exposes how conditional PSKY's certainty actually is."
