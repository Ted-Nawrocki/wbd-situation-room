title: "Netflix Signs Definitive Merger Agreement"
fact: "WBD and Netflix entered into a definitive merger agreement for Netflix to acquire the WBD Streaming & Studios business following the separation of the Global Linear Networks business. Under the agreement, WBD stockholders would receive $23.25 in cash plus Netflix voting stock per share, in addition to shares in the separated Discovery Global entity. The WBD Board unanimously approved the transaction."
context: "Netflix moved decisively where PSKY could not. While PSKY spent September through November making proposals that WBD repeatedly rejected, Netflix negotiated and signed a definitive merger agreement. The structure matters: WBD first spins off Discovery Global (the linear networks business) to stockholders, then the remaining Warner Bros. Streaming & Studios business merges with Netflix. Stockholders end up owning shares in two companies—Discovery Global and Netflix—plus cash. They get voting Netflix shares, not non-voting stock. From a corporate actions perspective, Netflix built on the separation framework WBD telegraphed in June. PSKY's subsequent hostile offer tries to tear up that entire blueprint."
