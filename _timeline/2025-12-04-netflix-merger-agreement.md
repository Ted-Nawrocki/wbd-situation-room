title: "Netflix Signs Definitive Merger Agreement"
fact: "WBD and Netflix entered into a definitive merger agreement for Netflix to acquire the WBD Streaming & Studios business following the separation of the Global Linear Networks business. Under the agreement, WBD stockholders would receive $23.25 in cash plus Netflix voting stock per share, in addition to shares in the separated Discovery Global entity. The WBD Board unanimously approved the transaction."
context: "This is the alternative ending. While PSKY was circling with all-cash offers for the whole company, Netflix was executing the separation-first strategy that WBD had already telegraphed in June. The structure matters: WBD stockholders get voting Netflix shares, not non-voting stock. They also retain Discovery Global, the legacy networks business. From a corporate actions perspective, this is the 'built on the existing runway' transaction versus PSKY's 'tear it all down and start over' approach."
