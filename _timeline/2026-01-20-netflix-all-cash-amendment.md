title: "Netflix Amends Offer to All-Cash Transaction"
fact: "On January 20, 2026, Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they have amended their definitive merger agreement to an all-cash transaction. The revised agreement maintains the $27.75 per share valuation, unchanged from the prior structure, but eliminates the stock component that was previously part of the consideration. WBD stockholders will receive $27.75 in cash per share plus shares of Discovery Global following its separation from WBD. The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash on hand, available credit facilities, and committed financing. The revised structure accelerates the path to a stockholder vote, with the companies targeting approval by April 2026. WBD filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC on January 20, 2026. The amended transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Netflix and WBD. The equity value remains $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion including debt."
context: "This amendment directly addresses Paramount's core argument. From the outset, Paramount has characterized its $30 all-cash offer as superior to Netflix's original cash-and-stock structure, arguing that the stock component introduced valuation uncertainty and complexity for shareholders. Netflix has now eliminated that objection by converting to 100% cash consideration at the same $27.75 per share price. This is a tactical recalibration, not a price increase. The move accomplishes three objectives simultaneously. First, it removes Paramount's ability to position its offer as structurally cleaner. Second, it accelerates the timeline to a shareholder vote by simplifying SEC disclosure requirements, with the companies now targeting April 2026 rather than late spring or summer. Third, it shifts the narrative from structure to price, forcing Paramount to either raise its bid or defend the $2.25 per share premium as sufficient justification for its whole-company acquisition proposal. The timing is also significant. This amendment comes five days after Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn denied Paramount's motion to expedite its disclosure lawsuit, ruling that Paramount failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. With that legal path stalled, Netflix has preempted Paramount's next move by addressing the structural critique before it could gain traction with institutional investors. The all-cash revision also demonstrates financing confidence. Netflix is committing to fund the transaction through cash on hand, credit facilities, and committed financing rather than relying on its stock as currency. This suggests Netflix views its equity as better deployed elsewhere and is willing to use balance sheet capacity to secure the transaction. For shareholders evaluating the competing offers, the decision framework has simplified. The choice is now between $27.75 in cash for the studios and streaming assets plus Discovery Global shares, versus $30 in cash for the entire company. The $2.25 delta must be weighed against execution risk, regulatory approval likelihood, and views on Discovery Global's standalone value. Paramount's path forward narrows considerably. Without a structural advantage, the company must either increase its price, demonstrate superior regulatory clearance prospects, or prevail in the proxy contest by convincing shareholders that board composition is the determining factor."
