title: "PSKY Makes Repeated Acquisition Proposals"
fact: "Between September 14 and November 20, 2025, Paramount Skydance made four progressively higher proposals to acquire WBD, escalating from $19.00 per share to $25.50 per share. Each proposal included a mix of cash and non-voting PSKY Class B stock. The WBD Board rejected each proposal, citing inadequate valuation, uncertain stock consideration value, governance concerns, and lack of committed equity financing."
context: "This is the negotiating dance in slow motion. Four proposals over two months tells you two things: PSKY has persistent interest, and WBD has persistent objections. Each rejection letter got more specific about what was wrong—valuation, non-voting stock, vague financing backstops. By November, the pattern was clear: PSKY couldn't bridge the gap through negotiation. That set the stage for what came next."
