title: "Paramount Files Lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court"
fact: "On January 13, 2026, Paramount Skydance Corporation filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav, and individual board members. The suit alleges breach of fiduciary duty and seeks to compel WBD to disclose what Paramount characterizes as 'misleading and incomplete' information regarding the board's financial analysis and valuation methodology behind its recommendation of the Netflix transaction over Paramount's competing offer. The complaint specifically requests that WBD rectify deficiencies in its SEC filings by disclosing 'basic, material valuation information' integral to shareholders making an informed decision. Paramount filed a motion for expedited discovery and trial scheduling, noting that its tender offer expires January 21, 2026, and 'cannot be extended indefinitely.' The lawsuit does not seek to halt the Netflix transaction at this stage—Paramount states it is 'seeking only disclosure of targeted material information' while reserving the right to 'seek further relief as appropriate.' Paramount also announced plans to nominate directors for WBD's 2026 annual board meeting. WBD characterized the lawsuit as 'meritless.'"
context: "Lawsuits filed in Delaware Chancery Court during live M&A situations are rarely about winning a permanent injunction on day one. They are about creating pressure, establishing a litigation record, and buying time to shift the narrative with shareholders. By targeting disclosure obligations rather than seeking to block the Netflix deal outright, Paramount is threading a needle: aggressive enough to signal seriousness, but calibrated to avoid overreach that could backfire with the court or alienate WBD shareholders. The timing matters. With Paramount's tender offer expiring on January 21, the company is working against a hard deadline. Filing for expedited proceedings is standard procedure in these circumstances, but the court's willingness to grant such a motion will depend on whether the judge views the disclosure deficiencies as material enough to warrant fast-track treatment. Delaware courts are accustomed to these dynamics and do not reflexively grant every request for expedition. The phrase 'increasingly novel reasons' in Paramount's complaint is worth noting. It signals frustration with what Paramount views as shifting rationales from WBD's board—first about process concerns, then about termination fees, and now about regulatory timing. From a litigator's perspective, demonstrating inconsistency in the target's justifications can be useful when arguing that the board is entrenched rather than acting in shareholders' best interests. That said, WBD has already characterized the lawsuit as 'meritless,' which is also standard posture in contested M&A litigation. Both sides are now operating in parallel tracks: legal proceedings in Delaware and a shareholder persuasion campaign in the market. Whichever path produces results first will likely determine how this situation resolves."
