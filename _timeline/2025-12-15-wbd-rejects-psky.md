title: "WBD Board Unanimously Rejects PSKY Offer"
fact: "The WBD Board of Directors unanimously determined that PSKY's $30.00 per share tender offer is not in the best interests of WBD and its stockholders, is not a superior proposal to the Netflix merger agreement, and recommended that stockholders reject the offer and not tender their shares. WBD filed a Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement with the SEC detailing the Board's analysis and recommendation."
context: "The 14D-9 is the board's formal answer to a hostile bid, and this one reads like a line-by-line rebuttal. The Board didn't just say 'no'—they documented why: insufficient value despite the $30 headline, high leverage in the combined company, heavy conditionality, and regulatory uncertainty. From a corporate actions perspective, the 14D-9 serves two purposes. First, it's the procedural requirement. Second, it's the record that says to stockholders, 'We looked, we analyzed, and here's why the Netflix path is better.' Whether stockholders agree is the next chapter."
