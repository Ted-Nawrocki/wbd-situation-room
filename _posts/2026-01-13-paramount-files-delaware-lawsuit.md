## The escalation continues

On January 13, 2026, Paramount Skydance Corporation filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Warner Bros. Discovery, its CEO David Zaslav, and the individual members of WBD's board of directors. The legal action represents a significant escalation in what has become one of the most closely watched hostile takeover battles in recent memory.

The lawsuit alleges breach of fiduciary duty and seeks to force WBD to correct what Paramount describes as "misleading and incomplete" disclosures in the company's SEC filings.

## Verified facts

**The legal filing:**
- Suit filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Monday, January 13, 2026
- Named defendants: Warner Bros. Discovery, David Zaslav (CEO), and individual board members
- Legal claim: Breach of fiduciary duty relating to disclosure obligations
- Relief sought: Disclosure of "basic, material valuation information" regarding the board's financial analysis

**Paramount's specific requests:**
- Compel WBD to disclose the financial analysis and valuation methodology used by the board
- Rectify what Paramount characterizes as deficient SEC disclosures, particularly regarding valuation of the Discovery Global cable business
- Expedited discovery and trial scheduling (motion filed simultaneously)
- Paramount notes its tender offer expires January 21, 2026

**Scope of the lawsuit:**
- The complaint does not seek to halt the Netflix transaction at this stage
- Paramount states it is "seeking only disclosure of targeted material information"
- The company reserves the right to "seek further relief as appropriate"

**Parallel strategic moves:**
- Paramount plans to nominate directors for WBD's 2026 annual board meeting
- The advance notice window for WBD's annual meeting opens in approximately three weeks
- Paramount will propose a bylaw amendment requiring shareholder approval for any separation of WBD's cable TV business
- If WBD calls a special meeting before the annual meeting, Paramount will solicit proxies against the Netflix deal

**Key quotes:**

From David Ellison (Paramount CEO):
"We filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer."

From the complaint:
"WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer."

## WBD's response

Warner Bros. Discovery called the lawsuit "meritless" and issued a pointed statement: "Despite six weeks and just as many press releases from Paramount Skydance, it has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer. Instead, Paramount Skydance is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value."

## Regulatory backdrop

The lawsuit arrives as both the Netflix and Paramount transactions face U.S. Department of Justice review. President Trump has indicated he will be personally involved in reviewing any merger, raising additional questions about the regulatory landscape.

## Banker commentary

Delaware Chancery Court litigation during active M&A situations follows a recognizable playbook. The goal is rarely to achieve an immediate legal victory blocking a transaction. Instead, the filing serves multiple strategic purposes: it creates a litigation record, generates public attention to the bidder's arguments, and most importantly, buys time to shift sentiment among the target's shareholders.

By limiting its initial request to disclosure rather than injunctive relief, Paramount is calibrating its legal strategy carefully. The company is signaling seriousness without overreaching in a way that might alienate either the court or WBD shareholders who are still evaluating both offers. Courts are sensitive to parties that appear to be using litigation purely for delay, and Paramount's focus on material disclosure deficiencies positions the complaint as addressing legitimate shareholder information rights.

The request for expedited proceedings is standard in these circumstances. With Paramount's tender offer expiring on January 21, the company faces a hard deadline. Whether the Delaware court grants expedition will depend on the judge's assessment of whether the alleged disclosure deficiencies are material enough to justify fast-track treatment. Delaware judges have substantial experience with these dynamics and do not reflexively grant every request for expedited proceedings.

The phrase "increasingly novel reasons" in Paramount's complaint is tactically significant. It suggests the board's rationale for preferring Netflix has shifted over time: from process concerns, to termination fee calculations, to regulatory timing considerations. From a litigation perspective, demonstrating inconsistency in the target board's justifications can be useful when arguing entrenchment rather than good-faith fiduciary judgment.

However, WBD's characterization of the suit as "meritless" is equally standard. Both parties are now operating on parallel tracks: legal proceedings in Delaware and a shareholder persuasion campaign in the market. The path that produces results first will likely determine the outcome of this situation.

One final observation: Paramount's decision to reserve the right to seek "further relief as appropriate" is significant. It leaves open the possibility of requesting an injunction if the disclosure strategy does not produce the desired effect. This preserves optionality while avoiding the immediate costs of seeking to block the Netflix deal outright.

The timeline between now and January 21 will be determinative. If Paramount cannot secure meaningful momentum through court proceedings, shareholder support, or board engagement, its options narrow considerably once the tender offer expires.
