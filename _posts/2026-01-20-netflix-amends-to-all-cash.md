## Structure becomes the story

On January 20, 2026, Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they have amended their definitive merger agreement to an all-cash transaction. The revised structure maintains the $27.75 per share valuation but eliminates the stock component that was previously part of the consideration.

This is not a price increase. This is a structural recalibration designed to remove Paramount's most persuasive argument.

## Just The Facts

**The amended transaction:**
- $27.75 per WBD share in all cash (previously $23.25 cash + $4.50 in Netflix stock)
- Equity value: $72 billion
- Total enterprise value: approximately $82.7 billion (including debt)
- WBD stockholders also receive shares of Discovery Global following separation
- Financing: combination of cash on hand, available credit facilities, and committed financing
- Unanimously approved by boards of both Netflix and WBD

**Timeline acceleration:**
- WBD filed preliminary proxy statement on January 20, 2026
- Companies targeting shareholder vote by April 2026 (previously late spring/summer)
- All-cash structure simplifies SEC disclosure requirements
- Separation of Discovery Global still expected 6-9 months before transaction close

**Strategic rationale (from company statements):**
- Simplifies transaction structure
- Provides greater certainty of value for WBD stockholders
- Accelerates path to stockholder vote
- Enhances execution certainty

**Key quotes:**

David Zaslav (WBD CEO):
"By coming together with Netflix, we will combine the stories Warner Bros. has told that have captured the world's attention for more than a century and ensure audiences continue to enjoy them for generations to come."

Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr. (WBD Board Chair):
"By transitioning to all-cash consideration, we can now deliver the incredible value of our combination with Netflix at even greater levels of certainty, while providing our stockholders the opportunity to participate in management's strategic plans to realize the value of Discovery Global's iconic brands and global reach."

Ted Sarandos (Netflix Co-CEO):
"Together, Netflix and Warner Bros. will deliver broader choice and greater value to audiences worldwide, enhancing access to world-class television and film both at home and in theaters."

## Paramount's position

Paramount declined to comment when reached by the Associated Press on Tuesday. However, the company's tender offer for WBD shares at $30 per share remains active, with the current deadline set for Wednesday, January 21, 2026, at 5:00 PM ET. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Paramount was planning another extension of this deadline.

Paramount's proxy fight strategy also remains in effect, with plans to nominate directors before WBD's next shareholder meeting.

## Delaware Court context

The amendment comes five days after Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn denied Paramount's motion to expedite its disclosure lawsuit against WBD. The court ruled that Paramount failed to demonstrate it would suffer "cognizable irreparable harm" without the expedited proceedings.

Chancellor Zurn stated: "Paramount as a stockholder must suffer cognizable, irreparable harm. It has not identified any."

WBD characterized the ruling as confirmation that "the lawsuit by Paramount Skydance was yet another unserious attempt to distract and the Judge saw right through it."

Paramount downplayed the setback, stating the ruling "was based on Paramount's standing and does not pertain to the merits of Paramount's claim."

## Ted's Takes

This amendment represents tactical discipline, not desperation. Netflix had the option to increase price, but chose instead to address structure. That choice reveals confidence in the underlying valuation and a calculated assessment that Paramount's argument rested more on complexity than on economics.

From the outset, Paramount positioned its all-cash offer as structurally superior to Netflix's cash-and-stock proposal. The stock component introduced variables: Netflix's trading price, collar mechanics, tax treatment for shareholders, and disclosure complexity. Paramount leveraged this to argue that its offer provided certainty while Netflix's required shareholders to evaluate equity risk.

Netflix has now removed that objection entirely. The revised transaction is $27.75 in all-cash consideration, eliminating any dependency on Netflix's stock performance or shareholder views on taking equity in the combined entity. This forces the comparison back to price: $27.75 for the studios and streaming assets (plus Discovery Global shares) versus $30 for the entire company.

The $2.25 per share differential is now the cleanest measure of the competing offers. Shareholders must decide whether that premium justifies accepting Paramount's whole-company acquisition, with its attendant integration risk, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about Discovery Global's value under Paramount's ownership structure.

Timing is equally significant. By converting to all-cash, Netflix accelerates the SEC review process and compresses the timeline to a shareholder vote. The companies are now targeting April 2026, versus the late spring or summer timeframe under the prior structure. This reduces the window available for Paramount to shift momentum through its proxy contest or to pressure the board through continued public campaigns.

The financing structure also signals confidence. Netflix is committing to fund the transaction through cash on hand, available credit facilities, and committed financing. This approach avoids stock dilution and demonstrates that Netflix views deploying balance sheet capacity for this acquisition as preferable to using equity as currency. It also removes any uncertainty about financing availability or shareholder approval of stock issuance.

From a corporate actions perspective, all-cash transactions simplify execution. There are no exchange ratios to administer, no fractional share treatments to resolve, and no post-closing true-up mechanisms. Shareholders tender for a known dollar amount, and settlement occurs in cash. The operational risk profile contracts meaningfully.

For Paramount, this amendment narrows the path forward. The structural critique that framed much of the company's public messaging has been neutralized. Paramount now faces a binary choice: raise the bid to create a meaningful price gap, or rely entirely on the proxy contest to install a board willing to engage on different terms.

The Delaware Court ruling five days earlier adds additional context. With the motion to expedite denied, Paramount's litigation strategy has stalled on procedural grounds. The court found no irreparable harm justifying expedited treatment, which suggests skepticism about whether additional disclosure would materially alter the shareholder calculus. Netflix's amendment compounds this dynamic by addressing disclosure concerns preemptively through the revised proxy filing.

One final observation on execution risk. All-cash structures reduce but do not eliminate regulatory scrutiny. The Department of Justice review process remains unchanged, and political attention on media consolidation continues. However, removing the stock component simplifies the competitive analysis by eliminating questions about Netflix's post-transaction ownership concentration or shareholder alignment with long-term strategic direction.

The amended offer does not guarantee success. But it removes variables, accelerates timelines, and forces Paramount to compete on price rather than structure. In contested M&A, that kind of tactical recalibration often proves determinative.

**What this means for the timeline:**
- Shareholder vote potentially as early as April 2026
- Paramount's tender offer deadline extended to January 21, 2026 (likely to be extended further)
- Proxy contest timeline unaffected
- Discovery Global separation still expected 6-9 months before Netflix transaction closes
