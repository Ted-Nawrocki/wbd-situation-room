## WBD Board Unanimously Rejects PSKY Tender Offer

The Board of Directors of Warner Bros. Discovery has unanimously determined that Paramount Skydance's unsolicited $30.00 per share tender offer is not in the best interests of WBD and its stockholders.

### What Happened

On December 15, 2025, WBD filed a **Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement** with the SEC in response to PSKY's hostile tender offer launched on December 8, 2025.

**The Board's formal recommendation:**
- **Reject** the PSKY tender offer
- **Do not tender** shares to PSKY
- **Reaffirm support** for the Netflix merger agreement

### Key Findings from the 14D-9

The WBD Board's analysis identified multiple concerns with PSKY's offer:

**Insufficient Value**
- Despite the $30 headline price, the Board determined the offer does not adequately compensate shareholders for control of WBD
- The Board believes the Netflix transaction path delivers superior value when accounting for total consideration and execution certainty

**Heavy Conditionality**
PSKY's offer includes 10 conditions precedent, including:
- WBD must sign PSKY's proposed merger agreement
- WBD must abandon the separation plan
- WBD must terminate the Netflix merger agreement (triggering a $2.8B termination fee)
- Majority of shares must be tendered
- No material adverse effect can occur

**Financing and Leverage Concerns**
- PSKY's proposal would create a combined company with approximately $66 billion in debt (~5.4x 2026E EBITDA before synergies)
- This leverage level is significantly above industry peers
- Earlier PSKY proposals lacked committed equity financing details

**Governance Issues**
- Prior PSKY proposals included non-voting Class B stock, providing no governance rights to WBD shareholders
- The Ellison family would retain voting control despite owning a minority economic interest

**Regulatory Uncertainty**
- Horizontal consolidation of two major media companies presents substantial regulatory risk
- PSKY's $5B reverse termination fee deemed inadequate given regulatory complexity
- Netflix's $5.8B reverse termination fee provides superior downside protection

### Timeline of PSKY Proposals

The 14D-9 documents PSKY's escalating offers from September through December 2025:

| Date | Offer Price | Structure | WBD Response |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Sept 14, 2025 | ~$19.00/share | 60/40 cash-stock | Rejected Sept 22 |
| Sept 30, 2025 | ~$22.00/share | 66.7/33.3 cash-stock | Rejected Oct 8 |
| Oct 13, 2025 | $23.50/share | 80/20 cash-stock | Rejected Oct 21 |
| Nov 20, 2025 | $25.50/share | 85/15 cash-stock | Not formally addressed |
| **Dec 8, 2025** | **$30.00/share** | **All cash (hostile)** | **Rejected Dec 15** |

### The Netflix Alternative

The Board reaffirmed that the Netflix merger agreement represents a superior path:

**Structure:**
1. WBD completes separation of Global Linear Networks (becomes "Discovery Global")
2. Remaining WBD (Warner Bros. Streaming & Studios) merges with Netflix
3. Stockholders receive:
   - Shares in Discovery Global (via spin-off)
   - $23.25 cash per WBD share
   - Netflix voting stock (based on 15-day VWAP with collar)

**Advantages cited:**
- Signed definitive agreement (vs. conditional tender offer)
- Voting stock in combined entity
- Lower regulatory risk (vertical vs. horizontal integration)
- Builds on WBD's existing separation framework
- Higher reverse termination fee ($5.8B vs. $5.0B)

### What Happens Next

**PSKY Tender Offer Timeline:**
- Offer expires: **January 8, 2026** (unless extended)
- Shareholders have until expiration to decide whether to tender

**WBD's Position:**
- Board unanimously recommends shareholders **reject** the offer
- WBD continues to pursue Netflix merger and separation plan
- Mid-2026 target closing for Netflix transaction

### Corporate Actions Perspective

**Just the facts:**
The 14D-9 is WBD's formal response to a hostile tender offer, as required under SEC regulations. It documents the Board's analysis, recommendation, and the factors considered in reaching its decision.

**Ted's Take:**
This is a textbook 14D-9 in a contested situation. The Board didn't just say "no"—they built a record. Line by line, they addressed valuation, conditions, financing, governance, and regulatory risk. They compared PSKY's offer to the Netflix alternative and explained why they believe Netflix delivers more value with greater certainty.

The conditionality matters. PSKY's offer can't close unless WBD agrees to sign their merger agreement and abandon Netflix. That's not a typical tender offer—it's a tender offer designed to create pressure, not bypass the board. The Board's response makes clear: we've analyzed this, we have a better alternative, and we're sticking with it.

Whether shareholders agree is the next chapter. But from a process perspective, WBD documented their rationale with the kind of detail that says, "We took this seriously, and here's why we're saying no."
