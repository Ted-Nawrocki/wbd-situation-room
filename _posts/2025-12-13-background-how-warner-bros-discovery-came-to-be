## The story so far

The current situation surrounding Warner Bros. Discovery did not begin with a hostile bid or a contested tender offer. It began years earlier with a strategic reassessment inside AT&T about the role of media assets on a telecommunications balance sheet. That reassessment set in motion a transaction that reshaped ownership, governance, and capital structure, and created the company now at the center of competing strategic interest from Netflix and Paramount.

Understanding how Warner Bros. Discovery was formed is essential to understanding the constraints and options facing the board today.

## Verified facts

- On May 17, 2021, AT&T announced a transaction to separate WarnerMedia and combine it with Discovery.
- The transaction was structured as a Reverse Morris Trust–style separation, resulting in a new publicly traded media company.
- The transaction closed on April 11, 2022, at which point Warner Bros. Discovery began trading as a combined entity.
- AT&T shareholders received shares in Warner Bros. Discovery as part of the separation, while Discovery shareholders retained ownership in the combined company.
- At inception, Warner Bros. Discovery assumed a substantial debt load as part of the transaction structure.

## Banker commentary

From a capital markets perspective, the creation of Warner Bros. Discovery embedded a clear tradeoff from day one. The transaction delivered scale, content breadth, and global reach, but it also introduced elevated leverage that would shape strategic flexibility in the years that followed. Many of the decisions now confronting the board, including balance sheet management, asset separation, and receptivity to external bids, trace directly back to the structure of the original AT&T and Discovery transaction.

In that sense, today’s contested dynamics are less a sudden disruption and more the next chapter in a story that began when WarnerMedia was first separated from its telecommunications parent.
