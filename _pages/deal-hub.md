**As of December 13, 2025**

## Executive snapshot

Warner Bros. Discovery is in the middle of a strategic sequence that began with its creation in 2022, accelerated with a major separation plan and liability management campaign in June 2025, and culminated in competing transaction paths in December 2025 involving Netflix and Paramount.

This page is written as a neutral factbook with clearly labeled banker context. Facts are sourced to public filings, company releases, and reputable journalism.

## Cast of characters

- **Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD):** the target and the company planning to separate into two publicly traded entities.

## What happened, in factual terms

### 1) May 2021 to April 2022: the origin story (AT&T + Discovery)

**Verified facts**
- AT&T announced a transaction to combine WarnerMedia with Discovery through a Reverse Morris Trust structure. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Discovery and AT&T closed the WarnerMedia transaction in April 2022, creating Warner Bros. Discovery, which began trading under ticker “WBD.” :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

**Banker context (clearly labeled)**
This is the “Episode 1” setup. The combined company was built for scale, but the capital structure and integration burden became central constraints in later strategic choices.

### 2) June 2025: Separation plan announced (two-company split)

**Verified facts**
- On June 9, 2025, WBD announced plans to separate into **two publicly traded companies** in a transaction intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- WBD described the two businesses as **Streaming & Studios** and **Global Networks**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- WBD stated that **Global Networks will hold up to a 20% retained stake in Streaming & Studios**, which it plans to monetize in a tax-efficient manner to enhance deleveraging. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- The separation was presented as expected to be completed **by mid-2026** (subject to conditions), and later communications tied the expected completion to **Q3 2026** in connection with the Netflix transaction sequencing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

**Banker context (clearly labeled)**
This is the structural move that creates optionality. Once you define two companies with distinct financial profiles, you make “sell one, keep one” structures materially easier to execute than under a single consolidated balance sheet.

### 3) June 2025: Liability management campaign to “enable” the split

**Verified facts**
- In connection with the separation plan, WBD disclosed the commencement of **cash tender offers and related consent solicitations** across its existing capital structure to “enhance its debt portfolio.” :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- WBD stated the tender offers and consent solicitations would be funded by a **$17.5 billion committed bridge facility provided by J.P. Morgan** and expected to be refinanced prior to separation. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- WBD filed materials on the tender offers, including SEC exhibits reporting early participation results and pricing terms. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- WBD also filed an 8-K describing an intended **$17.0 billion draw** of the bridge loan facility to finance early settlement of tender offers and other uses. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- In a tender offer FAQ filed on EDGAR, WBD addressed allocation questions and stated that allocation of bridge takeout between Global Networks and Streaming & Studios was subject to continuing evaluation and depended on multiple factors, including monetization proceeds and capital markets receptivity. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

**Banker context (clearly labeled)**
This is where “strategy” becomes mechanical. A two-company split requires debt, liens, covenants, and consent mechanics to cooperate. Tender offers, consents, and bridge financing are not window dressing. They are the plumbing that makes a future separation, spin, or sale executable.

## The BCG Matrix lens (explicitly labeled, educational)

This is an **analytical lens**, not a claim about management intent.

### BCG framing (based on segment economics disclosed by WBD)

**Data points (Q2 2025 segment results)**
- **Global Linear Networks:** revenue **$4.803B** and Adjusted EBITDA **$1.512B** (Q2 2025). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Streaming & Studios (combined):** revenue **$5.194B** and Adjusted EBITDA **$0.790B** (Q2 2025). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

### Interpretation (clearly labeled)

- **Global Networks as the “Cash Cow”**
  - Higher EBITDA contribution in the quarter cited above
  - Slower growth profile and structurally pressured long-term trajectory (industry-wide)
  - Capacity to support leverage and fund deleveraging

- **Streaming & Studios as the “Star”**
  - Strategically valuable growth engine
  - Lower EBITDA in the cited quarter, but central to long-term competitive positioning
  - More attractive to strategic buyers focused on streaming scale

**Why June 2025 mattered**
WBD’s June 2025 separation plan and related liability management actions created a clearer path to isolate a “cash cow” entity and preserve a “star” entity’s strategic optionality. The 20% retained stake feature and bridge-funded liability management steps are consistent with a separation designed to support deleveraging while keeping future transaction pathways open. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## December 2025: Competing transaction paths emerge

### Netflix path (Streaming & Studios focused)

**Verified facts**
- WBD filed an 8-K stating that on December 5, 2025, Netflix and WBD issued a joint press release announcing execution of a merger agreement and related transaction discussions. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Netflix’s release described the transaction as occurring **following the separation**, and referenced the June 2025 plan to separate Streaming & Studios from Global Networks. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

### Paramount path (whole-company hostile bid)

**Verified facts (reputable journalism)**
- Multiple outlets reported Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD in early December 2025, positioned against the Netflix path. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  

**Banker context (clearly labeled)**
This is a classic fork in the road:
- A targeted acquisition of the “Star” assets (Streaming & Studios) after separation, versus
- A whole-company acquisition including the “Cash Cow” (Global Networks)

The strategic and regulatory narratives differ, and so do the corporate actions mechanics for shareholders.

## Why this matters for corporate actions professionals

This is a live case study in how strategy turns into operational reality:

- separation mechanics and record-date complexity
- competing bids and shareholder decision timelines
- tender offer plumbing, consent mechanics, and funding certainty
- disclosure sequencing across EDGAR, IR releases, and media reporting

The “art” in corporate actions is seeing how each move sets up the next.

## Curiosity prompts (for practitioners and non-practitioners)

If you want to go deeper, these are the questions worth chasing:

- What is a **Reverse Morris Trust**, and why is it used in tax-efficient separations? :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- How do tender offers and consents “clear the runway” for a separation? :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- How does a retained stake (up to 20%) function as a deleveraging tool in a two-company split? :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- How should executives compare “certainty of closing” when the structures and regulatory footprints differ?
