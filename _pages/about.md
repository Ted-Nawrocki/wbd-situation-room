## About

I am a global custody operations professional with nearly two decades of experience specializing in voluntary corporate actions in the U.S. market. Over the course of my career, I have worked across complex restructurings, tender and exchange offers, contested transactions, spin-offs, and other high-stakes events that require precision, judgment, and disciplined execution. My work has consistently focused on the intersection of market structure, capital markets activity, regulation, and operational risk — where strategy meets real-world processing.

*WBD Situation Room* is a personal, independent project created to examine complex corporate actions events through a practitioner’s lens. It reflects how these transactions are experienced by the teams responsible for executing them: through filings, mechanics, deadlines, reconciliation challenges, and operational risk, rather than headlines alone. The purpose of this site is to share structured thinking, encourage intellectual curiosity, and foster professional dialogue around large-scale transactions using publicly available information.
