## Open questions

This section is intentionally not a prediction engine.

It’s a structured list of **the unanswered questions that will determine the outcome** and the **questions sophisticated advisors would ask in real diligence**. Consider it a live checklist you might see on a deal team whiteboard, updated as the story evolves.

Where facts exist, they belong elsewhere on the site. This page is about what remains unknown, what is contested, and what still needs to be proven.

---

## I. Board process and fiduciary posture

1) **What is the board optimizing for?**
   - Highest headline price
   - Highest certainty of close
   - Best long-term value for remaining holders
   - Lowest litigation and execution risk

2) **What is the board’s “credible alternative” if it rejects both paths?**
   - Standalone separation execution
   - Alternative partner / white knight
   - Modified structure (partial sale, JV, asset swap)

3) **How does the board define “best and final” in a two-path contest?**
   - When the offers are not apples-to-apples, what is the decision rule?

4) **What would trigger a shift from defense to engagement?**
   - A price change
   - A condition change
   - A regulatory posture change
   - Evidence of shareholder support

## II. Deal architecture and sequencing

5) **What is the critical path timeline for each offer?**
   - Which steps must happen first
   - Which steps can run in parallel
   - Where the path can bottleneck

6) **How rigid is the separation dependency?**
   - For Netflix’s path: what exactly must be completed before an acquisition can occur?
   - What happens if the separation is delayed or modified?

7) **What are the “deal-killer” conditions in each structure?**
   - Financing outs
   - regulatory outs
   - minimum tender thresholds
   - MAC clauses
   - required consents

8) **What is the most fragile link in the chain?**
   - The step that looks procedural but can stall the whole process

## III. Capital structure and liability management (the part that decides what is possible)

9) **How durable is the June 2025 refinancing framework under stress?**
   - What remains sensitive to consent thresholds, covenant constraints, or ratings events?

10) **What liabilities sit where after separation?**
   - Which debt is intended to live with Global Networks versus Streaming & Studios?
   - Are there cross-guarantees, structural subordination issues, or “stranded” obligations?

11) **Does the separation create a clean “saleable perimeter”?**
   - Or does it leave behind transitional entanglements that complicate value and closing risk?

12) **What does each bidder assume about leverage and refinancing post-close?**
   - If the plan requires refinancing, when and how is that executed?

---

## IV. Regulatory and political realities

13) **Which regulator is most likely to lead review, and why?**
   - Whole-company consolidation vs targeted acquisition can change the posture and complexity of review.

14) **What is the credible antitrust theory of harm for each path?**
   - Horizontal concentration
   - vertical foreclosure
   - content distribution leverage
   - platform dominance narratives

15) **What remedies are plausible, and are they acceptable?**
   - Structural remedies (divestitures)
   - behavioral remedies (conduct commitments)
   - timing remedies (hold-separate, transitional constraints)

16) **How does the public-interest lens influence process risk?**
   - Media assets attract scrutiny that is not purely economic. That can shape tone, timeline, and negotiation posture even where legal standards remain stable.

---

## V. Shareholder dynamics and activism

17) **Who are the true decision-makers among holders?**
   - Long-only institutions
   - event-driven funds
   - activists
   - index funds with governance policies

18) **What do shareholders value more right now: price or certainty?**
   - All-cash simplicity vs multi-step optionality

19) **How will proxy advisory firms frame the choice?**
   - If the deal becomes a vote, how will ISS/Glass Lewis evaluate structure, certainty, and governance?

20) **Is there a credible litigation angle that can delay execution?**
   - Disclosure claims
   - process claims
   - fiduciary claims
   - appraisal dynamics (if applicable)

---

## VI. Integration and “what happens the day after close”

21) **What is the integration plan, and where does it break first?**
   - Systems
   - talent retention
   - distribution relationships
   - content pipelines
   - international complexity

22) **What is the plan for legacy networks economics?**
   - If Global Networks is the “cash engine,” what is the strategy for managing decline without starving the growth thesis?

23) **For a partial acquisition path: what does the remaining company look like?**
   - Governance
   - capital structure
   - stranded costs
   - transitional service arrangements

---

## VII. Corporate actions and operational execution (where reputations are won or lost)

24) **How will the deal be communicated operationally to intermediaries?**
   - Election windows
   - eligibility definitions
   - response deadlines
   - reconciliation workflows

25) **Where will operational risk concentrate?**
   - record date complexity
   - loan vs custody splits
   - proration/allocation
   - cross-border holdings
   - dissemination timing

26) **What is the “failure mode” under deadline pressure?**
   - The kind of error that doesn’t show up in a press release, but shows up in the post-mortem

---

## VIII. The question behind the questions

27) **What story are the bidders telling about the future of media, and which story is actually executable?**
   - The right answer here is often not the most cinematic. It’s the one that can close.

## How this page will evolve

As filings arrive, open questions will move into one of three buckets:
- **Resolved** (answered by primary sources)
- **Reframed** (new information changes the question)
- **Still open** (the real work remains)

If you see a question missing, that is a signal. Add it.
