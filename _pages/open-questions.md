## Open questions

This section is intentionally not a prediction engine.

It's a structured list of **the unanswered questions that will determine the outcome** and the **questions sophisticated advisors would ask in real diligence**. Consider it a live checklist you might see on a deal team whiteboard, updated as the story evolves.

Where facts exist, they belong elsewhere on the site. This page is about what remains unknown, what is contested, and what still needs to be proven.

---

## I. Board process and fiduciary posture

1) **What is the board optimizing for?**
   - Highest headline price
   - Highest certainty of close
   - Best long-term value for remaining holders
   - Lowest litigation and execution risk

2) **What is the board's "credible alternative" if it rejects both paths?**
   - Standalone separation execution
   - Alternative partner / white knight
   - Modified structure (partial sale, JV, asset swap)

3) **How does the board define "best and final" in a two-path contest?**
   - When the offers are not apples-to-apples, what is the decision rule?

4) **What would trigger a shift from defense to engagement?**
   - A price change
   - A condition change
   - A regulatory posture change
   - Evidence of shareholder support

5) **How does the board balance fiduciary duty against entrenchment risk?**
   - When does protecting the preferred transaction become defending the status quo?
   - What evidence exists that the board is genuinely evaluating both paths on merit?

## II. Deal architecture and sequencing

6) **What is the critical path timeline for each offer?**
   - Which steps must happen first
   - Which steps can run in parallel
   - Where the path can bottleneck

7) **How rigid is the separation dependency?**
   - For Netflix's path: what exactly must be completed before an acquisition can occur?
   - What happens if the separation is delayed or modified?

8) **What are the "deal-killer" conditions in each structure?**
   - Financing outs
   - Regulatory outs
   - Minimum tender thresholds
   - MAC clauses
   - Required consents

9) **What is the most fragile link in the chain?**
   - The step that looks procedural but can stall the whole process

## III. Capital structure and liability management (the part that decides what is possible)

10) **How durable is the June 2025 refinancing framework under stress?**
   - What remains sensitive to consent thresholds, covenant constraints, or ratings events?

11) **What liabilities sit where after separation?**
   - Which debt is intended to live with Global Networks versus Streaming & Studios?
   - Are there cross-guarantees, structural subordination issues, or "stranded" obligations?

12) **Does the separation create a clean "saleable perimeter"?**
   - Or does it leave behind transitional entanglements that complicate value and closing risk?

13) **What does each bidder assume about leverage and refinancing post-close?**
   - If the plan requires refinancing, when and how is that executed?

---

## IV. Regulatory and political realities

14) **Which regulator is most likely to lead review, and why?**
   - Whole-company consolidation vs targeted acquisition can change the posture and complexity of review.

15) **What is the credible antitrust theory of harm for each path?**

16) **What remedies are plausible, and are they acceptable?**
   - Structural remedies (divestitures)
   - Behavioral remedies (conduct commitments)
   - Timing remedies (hold-separate, transitional constraints)

17) **How does the public-interest lens influence process risk?**
   - Media assets attract scrutiny that is not purely economic. That can shape tone, timeline, and negotiation posture even where legal standards remain stable.

18) **What is the DOJ's actual timeline for review?**
   - When do formal filings occur?
   - What triggers second requests?
   - How does regulatory timing affect deal certainty and bidder leverage?

19) **How does executive branch involvement reshape the landscape?**
   - What weight should be given to political statements versus formal antitrust review?
   - Does heightened political attention create pressure for more aggressive remedies or closer scrutiny?

## V. Shareholder dynamics and activism

20) **Who are the true decision-makers among holders?**

   - Distribution relationships
   - Content pipelines
   - International complexity

27) **What is the plan for legacy networks economics?**
   - If Global Networks is the "cash engine," what is the strategy for managing decline without starving the growth thesis?

   - What constitutes "basic, material valuation information" in the court's view?

34) **Is this lawsuit a genuine legal strategy or a negotiating tactic?**
   - Does Paramount intend to seek injunctive relief if disclosure doesn't shift the outcome?
   - Can WBD settle the disclosure claims without engaging on the transaction itself?

40) **How expensive and distracting will the proxy contest be?**
   - Cost in dollars

   - Cost in employee and partner confidence

41) **Can a proxy fight succeed if the tender offer fails?**
   - Or does the failure of the tender undermine Paramount's credibility with voters?

42) **What happens if Paramount wins board seats but not control?**
   - Minority board representation creates influence but not authority. What is the realistic outcome?

43) **How do institutional investors approach proxy fights in hostile M&A contexts?**
   - Do governance-focused funds view this as legitimate shareholder activism?
   - Or as a distraction from deal execution?

---

## X. The question behind the questions

44) **What story are the bidders telling about the future of media, and which story is actually executable?**
   - The right answer here is often not the most cinematic. It's the one that can close.

45) **At what point does process fatigue become the determining factor?**
   - Shareholders, boards, regulators, and management teams all have finite patience.
   - When does the cost of continued conflict exceed the value of pursuing the optimal outcome?

## How this page will evolve

As filings arrive, open questions will move into one of three buckets:
- **Resolved** (answered by primary sources)
- **Reframed** (new information changes the question)
- **Still open** (the real work remains)

With litigation now active in Delaware Chancery Court and a proxy contest on the horizon, this page will track both the transactional questions and the procedural chess match unfolding in parallel.

If you see a question missing, that is a signal. Add it.
