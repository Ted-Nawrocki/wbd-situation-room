## Open questions

This section is intentionally not a prediction engine.

It's a structured list of **the unanswered questions that will determine the outcome** and the **questions sophisticated advisors would ask in real diligence**. Consider it a live checklist you might see on a deal team whiteboard, updated as the story evolves.

Where facts exist, they belong elsewhere on the site. This page is about what remains unknown, what is contested, and what still needs to be proven.

---

## I. Board process and fiduciary posture

1) **What is the board optimizing for?**
   - Highest headline price
   - Highest certainty of close
   - Best long-term value for remaining holders
   - Lowest litigation and execution risk

2) **What is the board's "credible alternative" if it rejects both paths?**
   - Standalone separation execution
   - Alternative partner / white knight
   - Modified structure (partial sale, JV, asset swap)

3) **How does the board define "best and final" in a two-path contest?**
   - When the offers are not apples-to-apples, what is the decision rule?

4) **What would trigger a shift from defense to engagement?**
   - A price change
   - A condition change
   - A regulatory posture change
   - Evidence of shareholder support

5) **How does the board balance fiduciary duty against entrenchment risk?**
   - When does protecting the preferred transaction become defending the status quo?
   - What evidence exists that the board is genuinely evaluating both paths on merit?

6) **Now that Netflix has converted to all-cash, does the board's rationale still hold?**
   - The original preference was partly justified by structure. Does the all-cash amendment change the analysis?
   - Will the board revisit its recommendation, or maintain that Netflix remains superior on non-price factors?

## II. Deal architecture and sequencing

7) **What is the critical path timeline for each offer?**
   - Which steps must happen first
   - Which steps can run in parallel
   - Where the path can bottleneck

8) **How rigid is the separation dependency?**
   - For Netflix's path: what exactly must be completed before an acquisition can occur?
   - What happens if the separation is delayed or modified?

9) **What are the "deal-killer" conditions in each structure?**
   - Financing outs
   - Regulatory outs
   - Minimum tender thresholds
   - MAC clauses
   - Required consents

10) **What is the most fragile link in the chain?**
   - The step that looks procedural but can stall the whole process

11) **Can Netflix's April 2026 shareholder vote target actually be met?**
   - SEC review of the preliminary proxy statement
   - Any required amendments or additional disclosures
   - Practical logistics of scheduling and executing the vote

## III. Capital structure and liability management (the part that decides what is possible)

12) **How durable is the June 2025 refinancing framework under stress?**
   - What remains sensitive to consent thresholds, covenant constraints, or ratings events?

13) **What liabilities sit where after separation?**
   - Which debt is intended to live with Global Networks versus Streaming & Studios?
   - Are there cross-guarantees, structural subordination issues, or "stranded" obligations?

14) **Does the separation create a clean "saleable perimeter"?**
   - Or does it leave behind transitional entanglements that complicate value and closing risk?

15) **What does each bidder assume about leverage and refinancing post-close?**
   - If the plan requires refinancing, when and how is that executed?

16) **How will Netflix finance the all-cash consideration?**
   - What mix of cash on hand, credit facilities, and committed financing?
   - Impact on Netflix's balance sheet flexibility and future capital allocation?

## IV. Regulatory and political realities

17) **Which regulator is most likely to lead review, and why?**
   - Whole-company consolidation vs targeted acquisition can change the posture and complexity of review.

18) **What is the credible antitrust theory of harm for each path?**
   - Horizontal concentration
   - Vertical foreclosure
   - Content distribution leverage
   - Platform dominance narratives

19) **What remedies are plausible, and are they acceptable?**
   - Structural remedies (divestitures)
   - Behavioral remedies (conduct commitments)
   - Timing remedies (hold-separate, transitional constraints)

20) **How does the public-interest lens influence process risk?**
   - Media assets attract scrutiny that is not purely economic. That can shape tone, timeline, and negotiation posture even where legal standards remain stable.

21) **What is the DOJ's actual timeline for review?**
   - When do formal filings occur?
   - What triggers second requests?
   - How does regulatory timing affect deal certainty and bidder leverage?

22) **How does executive branch involvement reshape the landscape?**
   - What weight should be given to political statements versus formal antitrust review?
   - Does heightened political attention create pressure for more aggressive remedies or closer scrutiny?

23) **Does Netflix's all-cash structure affect the regulatory calculus?**
   - Does removing the stock component change any aspect of the competitive analysis?
   - Does it simplify or complicate the review process?

## V. Shareholder dynamics and activism

24) **Who are the true decision-makers among holders?**
   - Long-only institutions
   - Event-driven funds
   - Activists
   - Index funds with governance policies

25) **What do shareholders value more right now: price or certainty?**
   - All-cash simplicity vs multi-step optionality
   - Now that both offers are all-cash, does the $2.25 differential justify Paramount's whole-company risk?

26) **How will proxy advisory firms frame the choice?**
   - If the deal becomes a vote, how will ISS/Glass Lewis evaluate structure, certainty, and governance?

28) **Is there a credible litigation angle that can delay execution?**
   - Disclosure claims
   - Process claims
   - Fiduciary claims
   - Appraisal dynamics (if applicable)

29) **What happens if shareholder sentiment shifts mid-process?**
   - Can the board pivot without triggering additional litigation risk?
   - What does "changed circumstances" look like in fiduciary duty terms?

30) **How do shareholders evaluate Discovery Global's value?**
   - Is it viewed as meaningful equity or a declining asset?
   - Does this perception favor Netflix's partial acquisition or Paramount's whole-company approach?

## VI. Integration and "what happens the day after close"

31) **What is the integration plan, and where does it break first?**
   - Systems
   - Talent retention
   - Distribution relationships
   - Content pipelines
   - International complexity

32) **What is the plan for legacy networks economics?**

   - Loan vs custody splits
   - Proration/allocation
   - Cross-border holdings
   - Dissemination timing

36) **What is the "failure mode" under deadline pressure?**
   - The kind of error that doesn't show up in a press release, but shows up in the post-mortem

37) **Does Netflix's all-cash structure reduce operational complexity?**
   - No exchange ratios, no fractional shares, no stock elections
   - How much does this simplify back-office execution?

## VIII. Delaware Chancery Court and litigation strategy

38) **What happens to Paramount's lawsuit now that expedited proceedings were denied?**
   - Does the case continue on a standard timeline?
   - Does Paramount pursue alternative legal strategies?

   - Can WBD settle the disclosure claims without engaging on the transaction itself?

41) **How does litigation timing interact with tender offer deadlines?**
   - Paramount's tender expires January 21. Will it be extended again?
   - What happens if the court process extends well beyond the tender window?

42) **What precedents will the court look to?**
   - Delaware has substantial case law on disclosure obligations in contested M&A. Which cases matter here?

43) **Does the Delaware ruling weaken Paramount's overall position?**
   - Or is it simply a procedural setback that doesn't affect the substantive claims?

---

## IX. Proxy contest dynamics

46) **What is WBD's defensive posture in a proxy fight?**
   - Will the board nominate its own slate and run a traditional campaign?
   - Is there appetite to settle by adding one or two Paramount-aligned directors?

51) **Can Paramount install directors before Netflix's April 2026 shareholder vote?**
   - The all-cash amendment accelerates Netflix's timeline
   - Does Paramount have enough time to run a successful proxy campaign?

52) **If Netflix wins the shareholder vote in April, does the proxy contest become moot?**
   - Can Paramount's board nominees still be elected if the Netflix deal is approved?
   - Or does approval effectively end the contest?

---

## X. The question behind the questions

53) **What story are the bidders telling about the future of media, and which story is actually executable?**
   - The right answer here is often not the most cinematic. It's the one that can close.

54) **At what point does process fatigue become the determining factor?**
   - Shareholders, boards, regulators, and management teams all have finite patience.
   - When does the cost of continued conflict exceed the value of pursuing the optimal outcome?

## How this page will evolve

As filings arrive, open questions will move into one of three buckets:
- **Resolved** (answered by primary sources)
- **Reframed** (new information changes the question)
- **Still open** (the real work remains)

With Netflix converting to all-cash on January 20, 2026, several structural questions have been resolved while new timing and execution questions have emerged. The litigation path and proxy contest timeline are now decoupled from the tender deadline, creating parallel tracks that will play out over different time horizons.

If you see a question missing, that is a signal. Add it.
